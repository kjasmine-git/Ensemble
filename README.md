# Ensemble

The study utilizes a carefully curated dataset of 200 images (100 real and 100 deepfake samples) sourced from the Deepfake Image Detection dataset on Kaggle. This balanced collection contains high-quality synthetic images generated using modern GAN-based techniques alongside authentic photographs, representing diverse facial features, lighting conditions, and image resolutions. All samples were preprocessed to 224Ã—224 resolution to meet model input requirements and normalized using each architecture's specific preprocessing pipeline. A stratified 70-30 train-test split preserves class distribution in both subsets, ensuring reliable assessment of generalization capability.
